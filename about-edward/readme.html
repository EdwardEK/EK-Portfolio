Secondary Heading: Edward Emerson Kane. 

I'm currently a student at the Startup Institute in New York City. I have a bachelor's degree from American University in Communciations and minors in Marketing and Art History. 

All the web is a stage and all the UX/UI Designers are merely players #checkmate. I have a passion for web design and how it correlates with user interaction. How did this passion come about? I blame Photoshop and coffee shops. 

I am a creative person, who never developed the painting skills of Lichtenstein or the ability to create land artworks like Christo and Jeanne-Claude. I needed my own outlet to explore my capabiities so, I chose the endless possibilities of the World Wide Web. 

Thanks to my love of Caf√©s in urban dwellings, I found a interest in people watching. It's a skill that is highly coveted and not at all creepy, but it has developed an interest on how or why people do what they do. Small step for mankind, but large step for me. 

Passionate people create the world we live in.
