			<p>	First of all, let's just start off with saying that I love my 1 year-old Husky, Ollie. She means the world to me. Not to make this sound like a dating profile, but I enjoy playing tennis, snow skiing, and being lazy on Sunday's... but enough about me lets talk about design. </p> 
			<p> I'm a creative person, who never developed the painting skills of Lichtenstein or the ability to create land artworks like Christo and Jeanne-Claude. I needed my own outlet to explore my capabilities so, I chose the endless possibilities of digital platforms. </p>
			<p> Thanks to my love of Cafés in urban dwellings, I found a interest in people watching. It's a skill that is highly coveted and not at all creepy, but it has developed my passion on "how" or "why" people do what they do. </p> 
			<p> I have gained experience in past working environments, which has sparked the importance of UI/UX design when executing a task at hand. As an Executive Assistant to the CEO of a fast growing successful tech company, I was exposed to many aspects of Web Design and Development. Learning from experienced Coders and Designers in the past has jolted me to build upon what I have learned, what I will learn, and how to implement these techniques into any given project. Being a licensed Real Estate Sales Broker and having experience in Commercial Property Management only captivates the crucial element of how much companies rely on the users experience and interaction with their digital platform. The goal is to create heavy traffic for the site, but also having an experienced traffic conductor to guide the users.</p>
			</h3>

			<p>I believe that passionate people create the world we live in.</p>
